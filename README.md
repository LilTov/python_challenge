# Python Challenge

**Contributor: Liliana Tovar**

**Overview**
In this challenge we were tasked with writing code to recreate tables - 'Financial Analysis' for PyBank and 'Election Results' for PyPoll - from CSV files provided for each. This project comprises two main folders -  PyBank and PyPoll - each containing individual folders for code (main.py), Resources and Analysis.

For this challenge, all code was written for Python in Visual Studio using the CSV module and MacOS path formatting.

Many thanks to my tutor, David Chao, for helping me with syntax, sequencing and suggesting the use of a template in which to input and present Analysis results for each exercise. For the PyPoll challenge, I'd like to credit the YouTube video, 'Unit 3 - PyPoll Homework Walkthrough' (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdwlWjjwxlc&list=PLBNHcTwrlK2h-3_kPuZo597i3mMUOA0oe&index=2>) for providing greater clarity and efficiency to my own code, as indicated by comments in PyP_main.py.
